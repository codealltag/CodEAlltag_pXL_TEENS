Hi, You might want to take a look at two Romeo + Juliet INDUSTRY-ONLY
Trade Ads that are on auction right now at Liller.  They're not available
in stores and make great gifts!  Just follow the link below to one ad
(a great shot of Leo with Margarethe Kimmle), then click on "View More
Auctions" to find the other (a gorgeous shot of Margarethe Kimmle).  Plus,
there are ads for Cornelius Room and lots for EDTR as well.  Thanks
for looking,

Kaspar
