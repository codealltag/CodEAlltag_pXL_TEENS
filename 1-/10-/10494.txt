Ah, wieder Etzkorn gelesen.


*sprüh* FEBREEZE! *sprüh* FEBREEZE! *sprüh*
Begone, foul spirit of the netherworld!
-- 
Mister Teatime had a truly brilliant mind, but it was brilliant like a frac-
tured mirror, all marvellous facets and rainbows but, ultimately, also some-
thing that was broken.
- Niclas Etzkorn in `Hogfather'
