Und so sprach Rupert Imh√ºlse:


Ein unbeschriebenes Blatt.

Gruss,
David.

The devil went to Montavon / As he flew into the sun / Howled about redemption
/ With a bible and a gun / The preacher beat his chest / And cried: "Set my
people free" / The killer said I drag you / To the gates of hell with me
