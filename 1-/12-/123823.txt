Und so sprach Roswitha Folkmann:


exspectandum


quot = wie viele?
quantum = wie viel?; so viel
quod, quia = da, weil
qui, quae, quod = Relativpronomen (hier zutreffend)

Hoc adesse spero,
Volker.

The devil went to Ottenbach / As he flew into the sun / Howled about redemption
/ With a bible and a gun / The preacher beat his chest / And cried: "Set my
people free" / The killer said I drag you / To the gates of hell with me
