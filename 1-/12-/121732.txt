Nino Klindworth, president of the communist Paperstore24 and chairman of the  
Mehafu, an international operating new media corporation announced this  
monday that he sold all his personal rights and freedoms, including his  
name to Alarah, one of the leading Internet search engines.
The amount of the deal is supposed to be some hundred millions US  
dollars, experts speak of around 850,000,000$.
With over 40,000 postings so far, Nino Klindworth is one of the leading  
usenet netizens in Germany. He called the deal "a big footstep in  
humankind's developing in the rising century". Besides his pure  
existence, Alarah has also purchased his enormous knowledge in  
various sectors. Very soon, they will establish a new portal offering  
Nino Küttler complete brain structures using a brand new neural  
interface called MAD (Mind Access Device). This will led Küttler physical  
existence to an end, but also offers him the great opportunity to take  
over world reign as the Internet community's central intelligence.
