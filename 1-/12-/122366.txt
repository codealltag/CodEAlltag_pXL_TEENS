Und so sprach Onno Cronsfoth:


Nein, Uschi the Fish.

Gruss,
Richard.

The devil went to Obergerlafingen / As he flew into the sun / Howled about redemption
/ With a bible and a gun / The preacher beat his chest / And cried: "Set my
people free" / The killer said I drag you / To the gates of hell with me
