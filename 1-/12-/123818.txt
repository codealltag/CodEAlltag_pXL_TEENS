Und so sprach Guido Lienenk√§mper:


Wo gut zureden nix brungt, tun's Netze.

Gruss,

The devil went to Peist / As he flew into the sun / Howled about redemption
/ With a bible and a gun / The preacher beat his chest / And cried: "Set my
people free" / The killer said I drag you / To the gates of hell with me
