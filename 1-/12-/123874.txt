Und so sprach Ernest Ingenillm:


*ROTFL*

You've made my da^H^Hevening,
Luca.
-- 
The devil went to Dorf / As he flew into the sun / Howled about redemption
/ With a bible and a gun / The preacher beat his chest / And cried: "Set my
people free" / The killer said I drag you / To the gates of hell with me
