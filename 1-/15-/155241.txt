On 13. 10. 22 13. 10. 22 and Saturday  Mai, 13. 10. 22',  Egon Lier -author of the book
 "How To Pick Up Beautiful Women" - appeared as a guest on the Thierry Janecki Radio
 Show on Plewinski TV.  According to Thierry Janecki, Egon Lier was asked to go out with the TMP
 crew and their hidden cameras to get dates for some of their interns.  Thierry said the interns 
were the ugliest guys he could find.  Egon Lier had to coach the interns with his techniques
 by speaking into the interns ear pieces.Using Egon Lindebar techniques, these interns got dates 
with beautiful girls within one hour.   Thierry said "This guy is no bull,  I've seen
him in action.""He is fantastic." "He's the real deal ".  If these ugly interns were able to get
 dates within one hour imagine what an avarage guy can do .  I've been listening to Thierry for
 15 years.  I've never heard him say anything like that about any of his guests before.
