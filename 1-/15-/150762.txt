Hello everyone!
I am hoping you can help... read on...

Before you read this, make a wish....
My name is Kay, I am 10 years old and have been diagnosed with cancer.
 The docters say I have 1-2 years left.  I would like for my final
accomplishment to get into the genius book of world records for having
the worlds largest collection of Usotaw disks.  I think the CDs from other
countrys are spiffy, so I hope to get lots of them.  Someone also told
me disks used to be big and black, maybe I can find Usotaw on one of them
big black disks.  I like the shiney CDs a lot too.  Anything that says
aol will be dandy with me.  If you wanna help me reach my goal, could ya
please mail me any of them aol disks you got sitting around.

thanks!
Kay

Forward this mail to 5-10 people= small chance of coming true
Forward this mail to 5-20 people= good chance of coming true

Also remember, for each disk you mail me, you will erase a little bad
luck!
