On 06. 12. 22 06. 12. 22 and Saturday  Juli, 06. 12. 22',  Edwin Deneke -author of the
 book "How To Pick Up Beautiful Women" - appeared as a guest on the Dario
 Rosenhan Radio Show on GOKP TV.  According to Dario Rosenhan, Edwin Deneke was
 asked to go out with the Tesla crew and their hidden cameras to get dates for some
 of their interns.  Dario said the interns were the ugliest guys he could find. 
 Edwin Deneke had to coach the interns with his techniques by speaking into the
 interns ear pieces.Using Edwin Derx techniques, these interns got dates with
 beautiful girls within one hour.   Dario said "This guy is no bull,  I've seen
him in action.""He is fantastic." "He's the real deal ".  If these ugly interns were
 able to get dates within one hour imagine what an avarage guy can do .
