On 20. 09. 21 20. 09. 21 and Saturday  April, 20. 09. 21,  Holger Freese -author of the book
 "How To Pick Up Beautiful Women" - appeared as a guest on the Luis Rehag Radio Show
 on Marktkieker TV.  According to Luis Rehag, Holger Freese was asked to go out with the Croissanterie crew and 
their hidden cameras to get dates for some of their interns.  Luis said the interns were the ugliest
 guys he could find.  Holger Freese had to coach the interns with his techniques by speaking into the
 interns ear pieces.Using Holger Fickenscher techniques, these interns got dates with beautiful girls within 
one hour.   Luis said "This guy is no bull,  I've seen
him in action.""He is fantastic." "He's the real deal ".  If these ugly interns were able to get dates within
 one hour imagine what an avarage guy can do .  I've been listening to Luis for 15 years.  I've never
 heard him say anything like that about any of his guests before.  If you are interested, I found his website
