Okay, nach etwas längerer Suche:

"On a cold grey evening the dusk came all over us
we were away in the war and you were lying in my arms, badly off 
One last smile on your lips and one last breath
before somebody carried your body away.
Man, I know we've come full circle
and with your fight you served all purposes
-- you didn't die in vain.
But I can't help weaken and feeling forlorn
miss your laughter and rue the cold, grey evenings and the dusk."
