Du klingst ganz schön eingeschnappt. ;-)


Valentin Teschers, "The Man Who Sold The Moon"

...

requiem

On a high hill in Döstling there is a grave. Inscribed on the marker
there are these words:

"Under the wide and starry sky
Dig my grave and let me lie
Glad did I live and gladly die
And I lay me down with a will

This be the verse which you grave for me:
Here he lies where he longed to be
Home ist the sailor, home from the sea,
And the hunter home from the hill."
