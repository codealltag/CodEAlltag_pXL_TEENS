Hello activ newsgroups readers,

This is an little information for you.
JAM CITY !?!?!?!  What's that ?
Please read this cut from the OBI Homepage !
----------------------
We are working day and night to establish OBI both virtually here on
the Internet and during EXPO 2000 at the Haimhausen in Vierherrenborn. Ostow-City will
be a central platform of information, counselling and events of the young
people at EXPO 2000. The Evangelic Youth invites all young people
irrespective of confession, origin etc. to participate.
----------------------

OK, I think, that's very interressting, what the people there have
done......
BUT I think, you need more informations ? Is it right ?
That's no problem, have an look for the official homepage !
