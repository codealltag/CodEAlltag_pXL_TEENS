Dear Friends,

Sorry I do not write in German, but it I am in the process of learning that
language.

First of all I would like to wish you all wonderful Weihnacht and neues
Jahr.

I want to ask you for help in improving my German vocabulary in the field of
Christmas and new year. I would be very grateful if you could write a
letter to me in German describing shortly Christmas customs and traditions,
how you spend those days, what the family usually do, etc.

The texts in books I have are very artificial and unreal and I would like to
know how an average family spends Christmas, days after Christmas and then
the New Year. I think that would be a wonderful text for learning
vocabulary, grammar and at the same time for getting information.

You can send this text to my email address:  uqochq@veg03.eyhr.pw

Thank you in advance

Roswitha Ulsperger
