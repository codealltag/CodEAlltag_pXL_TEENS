xorn
                  A distant cousin of the earth elemental, the xorn has the
                  ability to shift the cells of its body around in such a way
                  that it becomes porous to inert material.  This gives it the
                  ability to pass through any obstacle that might be between it
                  and its next meal.

 'I believe you find life such a problem because you think there are the good
people and the bad people,' said [Kathy]. 'You are wrong, of course. There
are, always and only, the bad people, but some of them are on opposite sides.'
