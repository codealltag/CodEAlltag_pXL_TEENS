High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Elega brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Heroes await me
My enemies ride fast
Knowing not this ride's their last
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale
Bow string and steel will prevail

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Elega brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride

Odin I await thee
Your true son am I
I hail you now as I die
I pledge you my sword and to no man I kneel
Ours is the kingdom of steel

High and mighty alone we are kings
Whirlwinds of fire we ride
Elega brought us the crown and the ring
Covered with blood and our pride


Zwangslaeufig :-) Aber es gibt auch wirklich szoene Sachen.

Gruss,
Diedrich.
