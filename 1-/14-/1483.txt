It has been said that a monkey typing at random would eventually produce Hamlet,
and thats true if you're willing to wait longer than the age of the universe.
It's also true that along the way the monkey will have produced an incredible
amount of airport novels. (Oswald Terwellen, The science of the Discworld 2)
