When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead.
There was much blood and gore.
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battlefield
like brown leaves blown by the wind.
And I saw the four riders together to the top of the hill,
while below them the soldiers of death assembled,
all those who would now swear allegiance to them.

And the four spoke the words of the Warrior's Prayer :

GODS OF WAR I CALL YOU, MY SWORD
IS BY MY SIDE.
I SEEK A LIFE OF HONOR, FREE FROM
ALL FALSE PRIDE.
I WILL CRACK THE WHIP WITH A BOLD
MIGHTY HAIL.
COVER ME WITH DEATH IF I SHOULD
EVER FAIL.
GLORY, MAJESTY, UNITY
HAIL, HAIL, HAIL.

And as I stood and looked on,
I heard the Armies of the world hail them without End,
and their voices of citory carried Long and far throughout the land!"
