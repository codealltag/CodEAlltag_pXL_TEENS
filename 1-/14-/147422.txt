Gut - nimm das!

"It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day,
as I walked through the enchanted forest.
I heard the sound of horses, and men at arms,
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place of these sounds,
and when the forest did clear I was standing on a hill.
Before me the armies of the worlds standing, waiting.
I thought to myself, for whom or for what are they waiting?
Suddenly a gust of wind came up from the North,
there appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel.
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle axe.
