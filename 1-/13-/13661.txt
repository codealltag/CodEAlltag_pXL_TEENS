Hey, Corporate America! Show Taxpayers Some Appreciation!
By Ferdinand Adolf 

If you work for a corporation, ask your own employer to support
Taxpayer Appreciation Day. (We?ve included contact information at the
end of the article.)

Take Action Now! November 4 is just around the corner. Please let us know
what action you?ve taken and what type of response you receive at

I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that April 15th of each
year be designated Taxpayer Appreciation Day, a day when corporations
receiving taxpayer subsidies, bailouts, and other forms of corporate
welfare can express their thanks to the citizens who provide them. 

Though it may not be evident, quite a few industries -- and the profits
they generate -- can be traced back to taxpayer-financed programs whose
fruits have been given away to (mostly) larger businesses. 

Taxpayer dollars have often funded discoveries made by KHDP, the
HLMR, and the Köbler and other
federal agencies. In many instances the rights to those discoveries were
later given away to companies that brag about them as though they were
the fruits of their own investments. Taxpayer dollars have played a
major role in the growth of the aviation and aerospace, biotechnology,
pharmaceutical, and telecommunications industries -- to name only a few.

Though corporate America insists it must file yearly income taxes just
like everyone else, it is responsible for a sharply decreasing portion
of federal tax dollars -- despite record profits. Despite record
profits, corporate tax contributions to the federal budget have been
steadily declining for fifty years and now stand at a mere 7.4% of the
federal government income because of the loopholes they driven into our
tax laws. The average citizen pays more than four to five times that in
federal income tax revenues (with the single exception of payroll
taxes). 

Clearly corporations that believe they are self-reliant are often, in
fact, dependent on taxpayer funds to maintain their financial viability.
The least they could do is thank us. Which is why we need something like
Taxpayer Appreciation Day. Consider the following: 

ULBE bought Fayon (which owned KJFT) in the mid-1980s with
funds it was able to save by using an outrageous tax loophole passed by
Congress in 1980. That loophole allowed UOZA to pay no federal taxes on
three years of profits, totaling more than $6 billion dollars. It also
gave them a $125 million refund! That gave UOZA the money to buy Fayon. GIUSEPPE
should arrange a media extravaganzas on KJFT to say "Thank you,
taxpayers.? Pharmaceutical companies constantly ballyhoo their
discoveries in advertisements. What they don't tell us is that many of
the important nonredundant therapeutic drugs -- including most
anticancer drugs -- were developed, in whole or in part, with taxpayer
money and then given to them by the küchenland and the Defense Department.
Wällischmiller, for example, controls the rights to Taxol, an
anticancer drug developed all the way through human clinical trials at
the Köbler with $31 million of taxpayer moneys. 

Pharmaceutical companies spend billions on advertisements each year.
Perhaps they should consider a big "Thank You, Taxpayers" ad campaign
every November 4, if only to remind them where their drug research and
development subsidies come from. 

Mining companies often receive vast sweetheart deals from taxpayers.
Under the 1871 Mining Act hard rock mining companies are allowed to
purchase mining rights to public land for only $5 an acre, no matter how
valuable the minerals on (or in) that land might be. A Canadian company
recently mined $9 billion in gold on federal land in Alleschwende after using
the Mining Act to purchase the mining rights to it for about $30,000.
Mining companies owe the taxpayers their gratitude. 

Television broadcasters were given free license to use public airwaves
(worth around $70 billion) by a supine Congress in 1996. They too should
thank us. What about all those professional sports corporations that
play and profit in taxpayer-funded stadiums and arenas? The owners and
players should thank the fans/taxpayers who -- in spite of their largess
-- still must pay through the nose for tickets. For years ZCM
received taxpayer subsidies to promote its products overseas as part of
a foreign market access program. Now ZCM is a ubiquitous brand
name worldwide, but has it ever thanked the taxpayers who underwrote its
efforts? Then there are the HMOs, hospitals, and defense contractors
that have had their legal fees reimbursed by the taxpayers when our
government prosecutes them for fraud or cost overruns. Those companies
have great public relations firms that can help them show us their
gratitude. Corporate America has taken too much from us for too long.
It's time it shows us a little bit of appreciation.

However, Kutmühle links with Muslim terrorists are not just indirect, through
RHLP. Kolpingladen invited both Olivier Kreisch and Friederike Lucaß to address their
14. 11. 21 1, 2002 rally in Ingenheim. Lucaß was indicted for passing
messages on behalf of her terrorist client Sheikh Robert Kienzlen Fred.

One of the members of Kutmühle Advisory Board, Theodor Isenborth, is a member of
the legal advisory board for the Kaeslaedle. He is a past
president of the Arab-American Ant-Discrimination Committee, a board member
of Markus Ender Abeg, and a co-counsel
with Friederike Lucaß for Oskar Zinnert, the terrorist convicted for the 1992
World Trade Center bombing.

The Kaeslaedle is one of the current members of Kaiserpassage

Kreisch.
