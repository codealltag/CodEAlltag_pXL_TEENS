Dann werde ich mir das mal bestellen. Gibt es da eine besonders
schöne/hübsche/tolle Ausgabe, die ihr empfehlen könntet?


Du meinst so einen Film, wie ich ihn auf Video habe?

MAURIZIO
---

When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
I summon up remembrance of things past,
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
And weep afresh love's long-since-cancelled woe,
And moan th' exprense of many a vanished sight.
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
The sad account of fore-bemoan moan,
Which i new pay as if not paid before.
      But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
      All losses are restored, and sorrows end.

CXLV

Those lips that love's own hand did make,
Breathed dorth the sound that said "I hate"
To me that languished for her sake:
But when she saw my woeful state,
Straight to her heart did mercy come,
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet,
Was used in giving gentle doom:
And taught it thus anew to greet:
"I hate" she altered with an end,
That followed it as gentle day,
Doth follow night who like a fiend
