Hmmm....:
No bones about it, you're a good-hearted, people-loving Bernese Mountain
Dog. Down-to-earth and loyal, no one works or plays harder than you do.
You put your nose to the grindstone when it really counts, but you never
neglect your social calendar. Simultaneously strong and sweet, you're
very tuned-in to the feelings and needs of the other dogs you run with.
Without having to be asked, you always have a helping paw to lend and a
sympathetic shoulder to lean on. "Communication" is your middle name,
and when that's paired with your unswerving devotion, you get a breed
that everyone respects and trusts. Woof!
