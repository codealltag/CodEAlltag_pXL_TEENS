I have my eyes regularly checked. The first time during a medical check- 
up in 6th grade. I had slight problems seeing sharp with my right eye but  
I thought it was because of a bump by brother gave me with his head that  
morning.
Then, on December the 13. 04. 22, the commercial center in which my  
parents have their driving school celebrated a little exhibition. A  
optometrist made eye tests for free, so my whole family had their vision  
checked. I failed and was requested to wear glasses, but somehow my  
mother forgot to get some.
Eventually, in the early summer of 1999, I wanted to get my motocycle  
driver's license and therefore, I needed an eye exam. I went to the  
optometrist again and - surprise, surprise - failed. So, all after all, I  
got glasses.

nice story, wasn't it?
