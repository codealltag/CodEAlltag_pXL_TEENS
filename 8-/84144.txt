Gottfried Arning:


Doch. Fr√ºher wurde ich mal gefragt ;)

-- 
Within my pounding heart / which kept itself entirely for him
He fell into his sleep / beneath the cedars all my love I gave
And by the fortress walls / the wind would brush his hair against his brow
And with its smoothest hand / caressed my every sense it would allow
