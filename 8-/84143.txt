Onno Clausius:


Oh. Tschuldige.


H?

Lilly,
  das Satz nix Sinn?

-- 
Within my pounding heart / which kept itself entirely for him
He fell into his sleep / beneath the cedars all my love I gave
And by the fortress walls / the wind would brush his hair against his brow
And with its smoothest hand / caressed my every sense it would allow
