That screams "virus" nowadays. =:-O

(ObLinuxAdvocacy: Virus?  What virus?)
(ObPlumpers: It's a waste of bandwidth to send viruses.)
(ObToronto: Errrrrmmm....never been there.)
(ObFrance: Been there, but it's been a very long while.)
(ObAussieSport: I know scrums exist, but that's about it.)
(ObGayMultimedia: Not a bad idea but I don't swing that way.)
(ObEstonianMicrosoft: No data.  I've not been there, either.)
(ObGermanYouthTalk: Mein Deutsch ist sehr rustig.)

Followups.
