Why do people put up with this offtopic crap and crossposting to a dozen
soc.culture.* and whatever groups there are from other hierarchies out
there? Half of of soc.culture.nordic is anything but soc.culture.nordic
nowadays. It's so sad. Should we aim for a moderated group instead?

(Followup-to: soc.culture.nordic, news.groups)
