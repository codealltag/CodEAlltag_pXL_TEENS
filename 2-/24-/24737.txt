In Flames / Embody The Invisible
          I demand nothing, but I want it all;
          What privilege do we have under the sun,
          that gives us the right to the throne?

          Species come and go, but the earth stands forever fast
          all river runs towards the sea, but the sea is never full..

          To discover the loneliness and be to proud to show the wounds,
          will forever wander alone through the years..

          But I won't let you near,
          begging, begging for you to understand
          the fear that lives in my soul,
          which is an untouched spring..

          Read, what is written on the silent mouth
          what is written in the soul
          for which is written in the shining silence
          we all have to read

          My body will be bent from the burdens
          when the shaking floor of life force
          reveals its chasm underneath;
          if only one could be two steps ahead..

In Flames / Ordinary Story
          Egoism dictates human relations;
          a world where fashion outshines morality.
          Here success is written in blood-red colours,
          designed by the thirst for power..

          Gather the faithful and propose a toast
          to the epoch of indifference!

          An all to ordinary story,
          with an aftertaste .. so bitter..
          Forced to be someone I don't want to be
          I'm losing myself, sinking deeper down;
          I'm caught in the world wound web..

          A time represented by the void,
          an excuse without content,
          stuck in the abyss of existence..

In Flames / Suburban Me
          The self-inflicted state of mind,
          a one-man struggle beneath the tower..
          I think the clock still exists;
          God just forgot to tap my shoulder.

          I woke up today;
          I wish I felt something;
          The odour of my apathy 
          just might be true..

          I want to be the things I see,
          the pilgrim that is me,
          but I know I ain't that free,
          the suburban that is me..

          Spirits rise and miss the eye,
          covered by the stench of judgment
          as gods reflection test my pride,
          I serve the failure that's haunting me 

          Twisted visions torturing,
          who claims to be the one? 
          That filtered smile 
          just might be true..

          "On half-speed, tonight I suffer;
          Satisfaction brings the unheeded" 

          Can you hear the message, 
          as I wrestle with the clouds? 
          I'm on the way to succumb, 
          It just might be true..
