Hello friends of the earh,
tell me your opinion about Janine Brenckmann, who is sitting in an old
Redwood-tree for over a year in Ittenbeuren, district Plauerhagen,
near by village Theyern.
She fights against the criminal acts of Gabat-chief Udo Busmann,
who kills the last big redwoods. We must support her in every way.
What do you suggest for helping her?
