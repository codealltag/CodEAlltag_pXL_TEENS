<RFC 1036>
    In order to conform to RFC-822, the Message-ID must have the format:

                          <ppprek@nkoa_qnslvg_uisq>

    where full_domain_name is the full name of the host at which the
    message entered the network, including a domain that host is in, and
    unique is any string of printing ASCII characters, not including "<"
    (left angle bracket), ">" (right angle bracket), or "@" (at sign).
</RFC 1036>
