Und so sprach Jean-Paul SÃ¶hnlein:


-- Grandfather, tell me a story!
== Alright, go and get your storybook.
-- No, No, not one of those, a real story!
== A real story?
-- Yes, tell me about when you were a boy.
== Well, then, I shall have to take you back
   With me, a long way in time...

Gruss,
Franco.
