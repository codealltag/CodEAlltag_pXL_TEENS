Hi Ihrs!

Also eine Freundin von mir aus Amiland, hat mir folgendes gemailt...

I want you to do me a favor.  Hermann collects the Ty Beanie Babies.  Have
you heard of these?   She has about 90 right now.  Anyway, Siebelt just
released a Siebelt Europe exclusive in January called GERMANIA.  I think you
will be able to get this in Germany.

Hat jemand von euch schon davon gehoert? Kann mir mal wer sagen, was das
ist? Danke!
