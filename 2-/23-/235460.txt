Hi!

Just wanted to hear a few ideas / opinions:
I'm in a quite complicated situation now.I love a classmate, she is 1 3/4
yrs older than me, has a boyfriend (but he lives 3000 miles from here) nd
we get along very well . We meet four or five times a week, and hug each
other etc etc, but But how could I tell her that I want to go out with her
I mean it's no prob' to chat someone up at a party or so but if you know
someone very well for years, it's difficult to interpret the 'indicators'(ie
'yes'). And I'm afraid that if I say that I love her, she might ignore me
and misinterprete everything.

Help greatly apprechiated
