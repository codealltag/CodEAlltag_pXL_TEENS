Bei mir sieht das anders aus, aber die Funktion schein die gleiche zu sein:

# man rm
Formatting /usr/man/man1/rm.1


RM(1)                     Minix Programmer's Manual                      RM(1)


NAME
     rm - remove a file

SYNOPSIS
     rm [-ifrRvx] name ...

OPTIONS

     -i   Interactive remove: ask before removing

     -f   Forced remove: no questions asked

     -rR  Remove directories and their contents

     -v   Tell what rm is removing

     -x   Do not cross device boundaries

EXAMPLES

     rm file             # Remove file

     rm -i *.c           # Remove .c files, asking about each

DESCRIPTION

     Rm removes one or more files.  If a file has no write permission, rm asks
     for  permission (type 'y' or 'n') unless -f is specified.  If the file is
     a directory, it will be recursively descended and removed if and only  if
     the -R flag is present.

     cp(1), mv(1), rmdir(1), unlink(2), rmdir(2).
