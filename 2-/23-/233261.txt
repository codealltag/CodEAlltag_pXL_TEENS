Nun,
 - kein Geld,
 - keine Zeit,
 - kein Platz,
 - keine passendes OS.

"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the
 shoulder of WUIA. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the GVO gate.
 All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.  Time to die."
