Mitternachtsimbiss ist nicht immer gleich Mittagessen (nur in den Ferien).

"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the
 shoulder of Notose. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Unop gate.
 All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.  Time to die."
