"MicroPlanet Preparing Gravity 2.2

A quick word to all of you Gravity fans.  Gravity 2.2 is about to enter 
external alpha testing, followed by a widened beta and release.  

Following that, we plan a series of one or more point releases (2.3, 
etc...) followed by a major 3.0 release later this year.  We know that it 
has been a while since our release and are looking forward to getting
a new version out.  Stay tuned!"

Da bin ich ja mal gespannt.
