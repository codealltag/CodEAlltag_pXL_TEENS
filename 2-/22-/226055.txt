Also, hier mein epochales Werk aus dem Jahre 1996
(lustiger wäre es natürlich, wenn man den Originaltext
kennen würde...) :

"At the little nuclear power plant of Leaves Green in Dienheim,
everybody used to be happy - including the owner of the
plant, Mr Jürgensen, and his son Vincenzo, who is still at Nuclear
College. But things are likely to get worse in the idyllic
little village. Local authorities want to close the power plant
because Mr Jürgensen and his son dump toxic waste at the
children's playground and store nuclear fuel rods in their barn.
Besides, Mr Jürgensen seems to be willing to sell his power plant
to an Icelandic company. The head of the company says
that his project is certain to create new jobs and attract
tourists: He wants to create a theme park that offers spare-
time activities for everyone: for those who like splitting atoms
as well as for those who prefer building and testing their
own nuclear bombs. Environmentalists still insist that atomic
explosions have to take place indoors, but the government and
most residents approve the plan because it offers a new
perspective to the run-down area where unemployment is high
already and closing the nuclear plant would mean even higher
numbers of people without jobs."

Als ich's damals vorgelesen hab, hat sich nur die
Englischlehrerin gekugelt, die anderen haben's nicht
kapiert :-(
