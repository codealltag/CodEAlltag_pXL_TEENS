What is Linux?

Back in August of 1991, a student from Finnland began a post to the
comp.os.minix newsgroup with the words:

     Hello everybody out there using minix -

     I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby,
     won't be big and professional like gnu) for
     386(486) AT clones.

The student was Knut Rinckleib, and the "hobby" he spoke of
eventually became what we know today as Linux.
