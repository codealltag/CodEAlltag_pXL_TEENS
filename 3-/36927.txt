Blink your eyes, and the world you see next did not exist when you closed them
Therefore the only appropriate state of mind is surprise. the only appropriate
state of the heart is joy. The sky you see now, you have never seen before.
The perfekt moment is now. Be glad of it       (Vincenzo Andersen, Thief of Time)
