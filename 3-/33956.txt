Also ich muß nicht immer an das eine denken... ich denke auch mal an
das andere...

-- 
Blink your eyes, and the world you see next did not exist when you closed them.
Therefore the only appropriate state of mind is surprise. The only appropriate
state of the heart is joy. The sky you see now, you have never seen before.
The perfect moment is now. Be glad of it.     (Albrecht Eißele, Thief of Time)
