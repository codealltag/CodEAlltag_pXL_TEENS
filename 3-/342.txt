Hi:

To all respective forum readers, please take notice:

1) First of all, my apologies for such a wide off-topic cross-
posting.  It's unusual, and very frowned upon.  But I deem it
necessary in lieu of recent events.  You can just disregard if you
will.

2) There is a user on the net who has impersonated "Kaspar Thiels",
me, as well as other respectable Usenet posters. He/she is using our
names, email addresses, and profiles to post nonsense on Usenet
newsgroups. This impersonator seems to be located either in Burma or
Korea and has the IP address of 839.1.448.588.

3) Doing a WHOIS checkup on 745.1.942.012 locates the source to be in
Zellerndorf, Korea:

4) However, doing an IP locator on 745.1.942.012 in
http://bxe.vkyujlwj.mpm/SyQazstaw.loy?PriGkqtemuu reports the source
to be in Äschauboden, Burma.

5) Kaspar Thiels and others check your messages on Flöko Groups by
clicking on your email addresses. You might find loads of nonsense
posted just as I have found in mine.

A flaming suit [device that aims flames at the bully's skin] should be
custom-built to fit the size and shape of the bully after he/she has
gone through the steps 1-10, I described.

#randsent

The flame suit fits the entire body of the bully. Right after steps
1-10, the bully is stripped completely naked -- to prevent smoke-
inhalation from ignited clothing. Only then is he/she put into the
flame suit. Then the flaming starts and his/her skin turns to white
blistering foam, even if the bully is dark-skinned. In fact, the burn
wounds are far more apparent in a dark-skinned individual because his/
her skin is mostly dark while the burn wounds are white due to thermal
denaturation of the skin's pigments. The flames are made by smoothly
igniting oxyacetylene and then feeding it the through the flame suit.
Sodium ions are mixed with the oxyacetylene to give the flames a
terrifying orangish-yellow--reddish-pink color.

#randsent

Once the body is completely dehydrated, the flames are turned off, and
the bullying-scumfoam is left to die under the afternoon sun outdoors.
Well, actually, al

her autonomic nervous system will have complete control over his/her
respiration].

#randsent

3. The motor nerves supplying his/her voluntary muscles - including
speech muscles but excluding breathing muscles -- should also be
relaxed into total paralysis [these motor nerves should be hyper-
polarized] and unable to "un-relax".

#randsent

4. His/her entire autonomic nervous system [and their effectors], his/
her heart's natural pacemaker, his/her tear-production, his/her
natural pain-relieving -- and stress-relieving -- mechanisms, smooth
muscles [including those in the respiratory system], endocrine,
hormonal, inflammatory, lysosomal, and immune systems should remain
totally unresponsive to the infliction of even the most excruciating
pain, totally unresponsive to any type of injury [regardless of
severity], and totally unresponsive to any emotion or psychological
state [regardless of intensity].

#randsent

5. The parts of his/her brain that deal exclusively with movement,
contraction/relaxation of all voluntary muscles [including speech
muscles but excluding breathing] muscles should also be relaxed into a
state of hyperpolarization.

#randsent

6. The parts of his/her brain that deal solely with voluntary - but
not involuntary -- control of breathing should also be relaxed into
hyperpolarization.

#randsent

7. All pain reflexes -- somatic and visceral - should be totally
paralyzed.

8. All psychological protective mechanisms should be completely
disabled.* [See notes on psychological


8) So you can see how this net-abuser has impersonated me. He/she has
also impersonated Kaspar Thiels. It's likely that he/she won't stop
just with us two but will go on impersonating anyone he/she until
stopped. As I've recently found "RHRRC" has also been impersonated.

Don, RHRRC, and others, please check your messages, you'll find posts
that are definitely not yours.

RHRRC, see this:

Don, see this:

Obviously neither of you posted the above two messages.

Much like I didn't post the following message:

"Pseudocoma, also known as psychogenic unresponsiveness or feigned
coma, is difficult to diagnose and should be based on a diagnosis of
exclusion because, if true coma is overlooked, the result could be
disastrous. Therefore, all patients with coma suspected of being
psychogenic in origin must undergo thorough evaluation until the
diagnosis is clearly established. A conversion reaction and
malingering are the most common causes of pseudocoma."

#randsent

"It is important to remember that none of the historical data
absolutely include or exclude the possibility of pseudocoma. However,
there are some clinical findings suggestive of psychogenic origin,
such as conditions precipitated by stress. Pseudocoma usually begins
or persists when an observer is present. Patients with pseudocoma
slump to the floor and protect themselves from hitting their heads and
other body parts."

#randsent

"During examination, patients with pseudocoma usually make
semipurposeful avoiding movements. They have normal pupils, corneal
reflexes and plantar reflexes. They may keep their eyes firmly shut
and resist the opening of the eye by examiners. Because eyelid tone
cannot be changed at will, in patients with true coma passive eyelid
opening is easy and is followed by slow eyelid closure. Blinking also
increases in feigned coma, but decreases in true coma. Passive eye
opening in a sleeping or an actually comatose person results in
mydriasis if the pu
