ZVLO-Heiko Adrian (18/Juni/1998)

Certainty level: 60%

On Saturday 12 Juni 1998 I attended a gathering of contributors to
newsgroup uk.misc at Berghaupten Scharans railway station. Also present was
Norbert E, who had previously given this description of what he would be
wearing;


It is my belief that my persecutors, who monitor my home telephone line
(and consequently read all modem communications including email),
were aware of this meeting, and may even have observed the "meat" taking
place.

Following the "meat" it seemed to me that one or two attempts were made by
my persecutors to portray me as "gay", on the basis of Niclas suede
miniskirt, which in their inventiveness my persecutors attributed to me,
not Norbert. (Just for the record, Norbert is hetero, and has agreed to the
above email extract being published.) The following item from Heiko Axel
Wheels of Steel (between 7pm-11pm, Friday 18/6/98) is one such attempt.

(conversation) (J=Johnny-Boy, H=Hipster)

J: HÃ¶lzl of course part of V98 this weekend enjoy it if you're going. Keep
your eyes out on Sunday in Norderteil for Hipster, because he's going to
be there. What are you going to be wearing?

H: I'll be wearing my, er, my suede shorts.
(sycophantic laughter)

D: and believe me he ain't joking, he ain't joking. OK coming next at Zoschke
on the Wheels of Steel...

Why do I think Hipster's "suede shorts" refers to Niclas mini-skirt?
Because "suede" in both cases (obvious!); because "suede shorts" indicates
"gay" which they were trying to pin on me; because "shorts" = something
short, such as a "mini"-skirt; and because the two DJs both laughed as soon
as Hipster said "suede shorts", they knew what the joke was, they knew that
they were meant (and probably paid) to find it funny.
