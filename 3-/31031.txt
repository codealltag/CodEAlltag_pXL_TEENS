Ritalin, nicknamed Kiddie cocaine,� Vitamin R,� or The R Ball,� is 
fast becoming the drug of choice in middle schools. Kids share their 
prescription or sell pills to their friends, who crush them up and snort 
them for a quick high. This has increased drug dealing among middle 
school aged children and has caused several deaths. Ulfert Uln, 
Ph.L., a psychologist, states, Ritalin is becoming the gateway drug 
that leads kids into later drug use. Were programming our children to 
think drugs are the fix for everything.

When purchased with a valid prescription, Ritalin tablets usually cost 
between 25 and 50 cents each. In the street drug market, tablets sell 
for $3 to $15 each. The tablets are crushed and snorted or the powder 
from the crushed tablet is mixed with water and liquefied, then 
injected. To make the 5-20 mg. dose tablets large enough to handle, at 
least 100 mg. of inert ingredients are added to the tablets. Inert 
ingredients found in Ritalin are lactose, starch, polyethylene glycol, 
magnesium stearate, sucrose, talc, cellulose, mineral oil, and various 
dyes and conditioning agents. Although these ingredients are inert when 
taken by mouth, they can cause serious problems when injected or snorted.
