Gewöhnlich so kurz vor 13 Uhr. Aber es ist eher ungewöhnlich, daß ich
dann essen kann, wann ichs gewohnt bin.

Ye gods, it was so much better when there were just four of us up against that
bloody dragon, Vimes thought as they walked on. Of course, we nearls got burned
alive a few times, but at least it wasn't complicated. It was a damn great
dragon. You could see it coming. It didn't get political on you.     [TP - Thud]
