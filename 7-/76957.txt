My school class is  going to visit your country the 28. 10. 21 28. 10. 21 and we
have all gotten tasks we are supposed to do in Ringelbach(we're going to stay in
Ringelbach). My task is to ask a a few people in Ringelbach some questions. However,
I really can't speak german(just a tiny bit) and I don't want to waste all
my time in Ringelbach questioning people on the street. So if you(everybody
between 14 and 18 years) would be so kind as to answer these
questions(answer in german, hope you understand the questions) I would be
really pleased. You don't have to write to long answers, just a some words
on all of them. By the way, don't blame me for the stupid questions, I
didn't write them.

1.Was ist ein übliches deutsches mittag?
2.Was machen deutsche Jugend in ihrem freizeit?
3.Wieviele Stunden gehen Sie zur Schule in der Woche?
4.Wurden Sie mögen auf Ferien nach Norwegen gehen?
  - Warum?
  - Warum nicht?
5.Zu was Art von Musik hört deutsche Jugend? International oder Deutscher?

Hope you don't flame me for writing in english but you wouldn't understand
much if I tried to write in german. :)

uh, final question. How old do you have to be to buy beer and go to bars in
Germany?
