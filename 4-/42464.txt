Oder, f√ºr den Sarkasten:
(courtesy of Three Dead Trolls in a Baggie)

I love you 'cause you're scared of me,
I love you 'cause you're meek,
I love you 'cause you're insecure,
Unconfidant and weak,
Some people say it's a powertrip,
But I don't give a damn,
I love you 'cause you make me feel,
Much better than I am.
I love you 'cause you worry,
You're always taking pills,
You always watch the evening news,
And it always gives you chills,
I love you 'cause you're shaking,
And 'cause you're always tense,
Compared to you, I'm Mr. Cool,
Professor Confidence.
My Momma taught me long ago,
'Remember this one thing:
Surround yourself with losers
So that you can be their king,
And if you choose to fall in love,
Pick someone with a curse,
'Cause no matter how bad you may feel,
She'll always feel much worse.'
I love you 'cause you're scared of me,
I love you 'cause you're meek,
I love you 'cause you're insecure,
Unconfidant and weak,
Some people say it's a powertrip,
But I don't give a damn,
I love you 'cause you make me feel,
Much better than I am.
So throw those self-help books away,
And that subliminal tape,
You're overweight -- but that's O.K.!
C'mon and have another cake,
Oh, I will be your better half,
And you can be my worse,
I'm goin' drinkin' baby,
So I took some money from your purse.
I love you 'cause you're scared of me,
I love you 'cause you're meek,
I love you 'cause you're insecure,
Unconfidant and weak,
Some people say it's a powertrip,
But I don't give a damn,
I love you 'cause you make me feel,
Like you are pork and I am veil,
Like I'm the fortune and you're the wheel,
Like you're the Captain and I'm Teneil,
I love you cause you make me feel,
Much better than I am."
