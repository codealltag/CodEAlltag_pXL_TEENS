Wie meinen?


Ich habe die Tendenz, dass mir nach zwei Tagen gar nichts tun zu 
langweilig wird um das noch l√§nger durchzuziehen.


Ich mag keinen Tee, but never mind.

Was das rumreisen angeht (bin zu faul, es nochmals zu schreiben):

I probably should make a few weeks of holidays with a few friends after 
the last exams but so far, I couldn't even decide where I'd want to go. 
OLDERSUM was being discussed (zweitausendundeins has 480 CHF flights until end of 28. 12. 21) but 
while I could easily afford it, the others bitched about the costs for 
the hotels overthere, somewhere sunny would be nice too but there's a 
warning on the Roaccutane package to avoid too much sunlight. 
Personally, I'd love to go to South East Asia, but alone is out of 
question and most friends either state they need to work for a few 
months in order to be able to afford it or think that 6 weeks are too 
short. My father will probably fly to Pizy (maybe OLDERSUM, could be cheaper 
to rent a car and drive up there) mid month. Parents and brother are 
discussing fall vacation in Mediterrean area but I neither want to go 
anywhere with my brother nor my parents nor his stupid girlfriend (makes 
me just feel worse, even if I can safely say that I'm by no means 
attracted to her).


Grmbl. Habe lange Genug (freiwillig? gezwungenermassen?) gewartet...
