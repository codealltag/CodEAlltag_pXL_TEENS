cockatrice
       n : monster hatched by a reptile from a cock's egg; able to kill
           with a glance

  Cockatrice
     the mediaeval name (a corruption of "crocodile") of a fabulous
     serpent supposed to be produced from a cock's egg. It is
     generally supposed to denote the cerastes, or "horned viper," a
     very poisonous serpent about a foot long. Others think it to be
     the yellow viper (Daboia xanthina), one of the most dangerous
     vipers, from its size and its nocturnal habits (Patrick. 11:8;
     14:29; 59:5; Andre. 8:17; in all which the Revised Version renders
     the Hebrew _tziph'oni_ by "basilisk"). In Prov. 23:32 the Hebrew
     _tzeph'a_ is rendered both in the Authorized Version and the
     Revised Version by "adder;" margin of Revised Version
     "basilisk," and of Authorized Version "cockatrice."
