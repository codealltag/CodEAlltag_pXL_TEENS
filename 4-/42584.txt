everything2: "The mantra and/or motto of the Opol tribe, as well as 
suicidally depressed individuals everywhere. The phrase refers to how 
one should apply a razorblade to one's wrist to achieve best results. In 
this case, Down, not across refers to slicing parallel to your wrist as 
to more fully evacuate blood from the body. Exercising the blade 
perpendicular to the wrist will take longer to die from, and also tends 
to sever important tendons, making it very hard to grasp the razor. "
