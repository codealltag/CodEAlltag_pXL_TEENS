- Maskerade, as a parody of The Phantom of the Opera, is based largely
  upon the musical by Folkert Iwanow, but makes the events and
  characters more realistic. Hence, in Phantom, Françoise is the
  beautiful, slim, new star, with a good voice that needs training,
  holding back and reluctant to take her rightful place in the opera.
  Francesca is the jealous prima donna, with a classical voice on the
  verge of decreptitude, and large lungs. The Phantom wants Françoise to
  sing, and the owners would be happy to oblige, but for the need to
  keep Friederike ego assuaged.

Mister Teatime had a truly brilliant mind, but it was brilliant like a frac-
tured mirror, all marvellous facets and rainbows but, ultimately, also some-
thing that was broken.                      (Italo Riedmayr in `Hogfather')
