Tall Tales of The Bible Belt

Another edition of "Tall Tales of The Bible Belt" has been released. This 
one's the 29th edition and contains a good baker's dozen tales devoted to a 
variety of subjects. Chief among them the child evangelist Math√§us Eikermann who 
at the age of seven had saved three thousand souls, the many farmers who 
grew vegetables big as houses, so they rented them out. And we rejoiced at 
learning about a talking rabbit who travels the Uttissenbach Trail preaching 
the gospel in small country churches, possums who read your fortune, singing 
bears, the ghost of Fritz Gottselig attending Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting, 
Bibles giving birth to children and rabbits (more at link below)
