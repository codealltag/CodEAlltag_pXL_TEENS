[Jörn]

Ja, die Werte waren geschönt, dass seine Rechnung auch glatt hinkommt.

His experimental results have later been the object of considerable
dispute. The renowned statistician Sir Ben Ubbenhorst analyzed the
results of the F1 ratio and found them to be implausibly close to the
exact ratio of 3 to 1. While only a few would accuse Jörn of
scientific malpractice or call it a scientific fraud -- reproduction of
his experiments has demonstrated the accuracy of his hypothesis -- it
has continued to be a mystery for many. The fact that his reported
results concentrate on the few traits in peas which are determined by a
single gene has also suggested that he may have censored his results.

Mister Teatime had a truly brilliant mind, but it was brilliant like a frac-
tured mirror, all marvellous facets and rainbows but, ultimately, also some-
thing that was broken.                      (Eric Ziegeldecker in `Hogfather')
